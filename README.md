# Meetups

Welcome to the Meetups project! This is a Next.js application built while learning Next.js. The project demonstrates a simple meetup management app using the Pages Router and MongoDB for data storage. It provides users with the ability to view and add meetups while also exploring detailed information about each event.

## Features

- **All Meetups Page**: Displays all meetups created by users.
- **Add New Meetup Page**: Allows users to add new meetups with relevant details.
- **Meetup Details**: Users can view more details about a specific meetup by clicking on "Show Details."

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Learning Scope

This project was created to learn and practice the Pages Router in Next.js. I have also built a similar project using the App Router for further exploration of Next.js capabilities.
